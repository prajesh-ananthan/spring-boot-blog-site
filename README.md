Web blog
========

This is a SpringBoot playground blog app that I have done that introduces Spring Data, Thymeleaf, Spring Security and REST API.

The blog currently runs on H2 in-memory database.

Once this is running, execute the app and navigate to the endpoint (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`).

The available endpoints are for now:

- `/`
- `/home`
